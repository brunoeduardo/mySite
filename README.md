My Portifolio
========

This is a template of my portfolio. I used the jekyll generator of static code to create my website.

It have a simple structure, four pages (home, about me, jobs and contact) and the website is responsive, it goes adapt in all type of screen.

The idea is show how is easy to do a website or blog with Jekyll.

On top each page there variables that will give the parameters to the Jekyll compile the pages, you do not need create all pages with top and footer, the generator make this. It is look like the server side code for example PHP but the difference is that Jekyll delivers a static code.

You can create template pages to do specific things like post page, contact page, list page.
